Greasy Pidgin is an implementation of various algorithmic composition principles. The name refers to the groundbraking algorithmic toolkit by Michael Edwards 'slippery chicken'. The wordplay on Pigeon - Pidgin refers to 'pidgin languages' - languages that come into existence when people that do not share a common native language come together and form a new language based on their contact language. As I am galumphing through a myriad of programming languages over the years I found little gems - and obstacles - in each environment which led me to this project: Trying to implement everything I love from each environment and unify it in a system that is tailored to my creative and compositional needs.
